REMODEL-LLM is context-aware C-to-Java translation pipeline that combines static AST analysis with LLM-based reasoning. It extracts program structure using pycparser, builds enriched prompts, and generates semantically consistent Java code via Ollama models, ensuring correctness through execution-level verification.
