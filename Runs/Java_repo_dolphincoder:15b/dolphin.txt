The fields in this example are both primitive types (int and float), but if they were complex types, the translation would be similar - just replace each primitive type with the corresponding complex type.

    For `union`, no text, no code, no comments. For `struct`, I've translated your C struct to a public static Java class with a default constructor, copy constructor and all-field constructor. The fields in this example are both primitive types (int and float), but if they were complex types, the translation would be similar - just replace each primitive type with the corresponding complex type.
