    // FAILED_EXTRACTION: LLM returned empty response.

    **HINTS (IF NEEDED):**
    
    1.   **FUNCTION DEFINITIONS:** If you have C functions defined elsewhere, copy and paste the signatures here.
    2.   **DATA TYPES & CONSTANTS:**
         * For all 32-bit types (e.g., int, long, float), use `int` in Java. Do not use the Java type `Int`.
         * If a C function uses a constant string literal (e.g., "hello"), use the same exact string in Java.
    
    **TESTING & VALIDATION:**
    
    Your translation will be validated by running it on a hidden test suite, then checking the output against the expected.
    
    1.   **CORRECTNESS:** The program MUST compile and run correctly without crashing/throwing exceptions or otherwise violating  language rules (e.g., array bounds checks).
    2.   **TEST CASES:** You will be given three tests to validate your translation:
         *   **Test 0** is the original C code, which you should translate to Java correctly.
         *   **Test 1** and **Test 2** are slight variations on Test 0, with small changes in the function body that you do not have to worry about.
             (e.g., changing the variable names or adding/removing a few instructions).
