    **TRANSLATION GUIDANCE (YOU DO NOT HAVE TO FOLLOW THESE):**
    1.  1 to many lines:
        1.  C statements are translated into Java *expressions*.
        2.  Most C lines end in a semicolon, but this is not the case for Java expressions.
        3.  You may introduce newlines (and indentation) to keep your code organized if it helps readability.
    2.  1 to many tokens:
        1.  Parentheses are added to make the operator precedence clearer.
        2.  C's `&&` and `||` must be replaced with Java's `&` and `|`.
        3.  Replace any C bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`) with Java's corresponding operators (e.g., `&`).
    3.  1 to many identifiers:
        1.  A C identifier may refer to a variable or a type.
            * Variable names are translated directly from C to Java.
            * Type names must be fully-qualified and prepended with `com.yourcompany`.
